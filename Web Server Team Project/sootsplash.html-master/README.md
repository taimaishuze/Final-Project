We encourage the teams to create a pull request and make the changes to their .html repository.  It's a great opportunity to learn about HTML and it'll speed up the process of editing.  You'll also be able to customize your section to your liking as we will not be able accommodate what your intentions are.  In other words, if you just provide us with your team name and members of the team, that's all you're going to get.

To add your information into the webpage, please use the "Issues" tab and provide your first name, team name, and Github ID. I will update the changes.

To make changes to your Webpage use the "Pull request" tab to edit your team's html document

I will review and commit changes :)
