## CSCI 2461 Computer Networking 2 - Linux

### Week 1 - 4
- [Hello World](https://github.com/taimaishuze/hello-world) - A look back at the glorious initial repository.  Getting the hang of using GitHub on the website and in the terminal.

Both of the following weeks were basic commands that I learned through the first couple weeks of the course such as updating, upgrading, partitions, remove files, and changing directories.
- [Week 3](https://github.com/taimaishuze/Week3Lab)
- [Week 4](https://github.com/taimaishuze/Week4Lab)

### Week 5 - 8
- [Week 5 Bootable USB](https://github.com/taimaishuze/Bootable-Ubuntu-Mate) - I decided to go with Ubuntu Mate for my persistant bootable USB.  It was pretty much the same as Ubuntu but in a "lighter" version.
- [Week 6](https://github.com/taimaishuze/Week6Lab)
- [Week 7](https://github.com/taimaishuze/Week7Lab)
- [Week 8 Midterm](https://github.com/taimaishuze/Week8Lab/blob/master/Review.sh) - For the finals, I used a menu system to demonstrate to run some of the scripts that I learned in the first half of the course.  Kudos to [EmanMac](https://github.com/EmanMac) for sharing this idea.  This was certainly a very cool idea that made my midterm presentation more appealing.
- [Build a menu](https://github.com/taimaishuze/Build-a-Menu) - Here is the original menu script that was used.  Some editing will need to be done to personalize the script.

### Week 9 - 12
- [Week 9]()
- [Week 10]()
- [Week 11](https://github.com/taimaishuze/Week11Lab)
- [Week 12](https://github.com/taimaishuze/Week12Lab)

### Week 13 - 16
- [Week 13](https://github.com/taimaishuze/Week13Lab)
- [Week 14](https://github.com/taimaishuze/Week14Lab)
- [Week 15](https://github.com/taimaishuze/Week15Lab/tree/master)

### "To infinity!  AND BEYOND!" - Buzz Lightyear
- [N-Arctica](https://github.com/taimaishuze/N-Arctica-Web-Server)
- [Team Project Board](https://github.com/taimaishuze/N-Arctica-Web-Server/projects/1) - Our team utilized this project board to keep track of our Final Project progress as well as check on what other team members are working on.
- [Taimai-wiki](https://github.com/taimaishuze/N-Arctica-Web-Server/projects/1) - Link to my Team project research wiki.
- [SootSplash](https://github.com/taimaishuze/sootsplash.html)
- [VBA warning script](https://github.com/taimaishuze/VBA-warning-MsgBox) - My curiousity into Microsoft VBA led me to this useful tool.  It basically will prompt the user to confirm they wish to continue with the button operation.  I used this in most of my VBA scripts.
- [Draw Poker](https://github.com/taimaishuze/Week15Lab/blob/master/Draw%20Poker.c) - This C program was copied from the appendix of [Greg Perry's C Programming Absolute Beginner's Guide (3rd Edition)](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Absolute-Beginners-Guide-3rd/dp/0789751984/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1525146349&sr=8-4&keywords=c+programming).  While learning about C programming, I went ahead and entered this code to see what the program did.  It was a basic Draw Poker game that demonstated most of the C programming language that was covered in the textbook.
- [Terminus](http://web.mit.edu/mprat/Public/web/Terminus/Web/main.html) - Thanks to Mark Rawling, Computer Networking instructor at Saint Paul College, who provided this link to a very basic game that used command line prompts to teach the user about Linux commands.
